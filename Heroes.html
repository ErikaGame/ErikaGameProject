			<h1>Erika</h1>
            <p class="changing-text">Erica was a dancer ballerina and a successful woman.Her boyfriend "Albert Reiz" was a successful and top creator of bio machines, weapons, robots. However Albert was secretly saving Jewish children from slavery, murder. But things went wrong, normally Albert would bribe the translators, but the man he knew was the German Army General himself, Albert ran for his life from the General. He ran past the central city, where there were many people, Albert knelt down and said: "You have taken everything from me without giving me anything", in the central square, around the people, Erika was hanged. All the insides were taken out, the whole body was beaten, tears were already dried on her face. Albert went up to the trebune and took with him the body of his dead bride, behind him the German army was already running, but out of respect for Albert the people attacked the military without fear for their lives, but they knew for sure that Albert knew what he was doing. Coming to his lab, he took Erika's brain and as soon as possible took the remaining memory of his fianc√©e, he started to make her a cyber body to keep her alive, but he didn't have time, just 3 hours later his main door exploded. Albert will never open his eyes again, in December 1939, Albert was killed and Erika's new cyber body was taken for study by the German Army, but no one knows where Erika's memory chip went.....
